# GOSQAS

This is the starting place for the GOSQAS (GAHS-kwahs), Global Open Source Quality Assurance System. GOSQAS and related marks and logos are trademarks of the Global Assurance Quality Assurance System, a US-based project fiscally sponsored by Public Invention. Our development philosophy of “Trust Through Transparency '' (TTT) encourages better global communication within diverse communities- including humanitarian response, open source hardware, and scientific research. 

GOSQAS has developed Global Distributed Tracking (GDT), a software platform that provides the opportunity to create truthful, transparent documentation via an uneditable, append-only record history. Designed specifically for low-resource settings, GDT does not require a login or download and is completely free to use, in addition to being free and open source software. All our code is open source, but we reserve all rights on our trademarks (see below).

The application is live, try it now! [https://gosqas.org/](https://gosqas.org/)


# FEATURES
GOSQAS is compatible with existing regulatory bodies, not a competitor, and supports the development of transparency, accountability, and quality assurance for humanitarian purposes. GOSQAS will legally defend marks and logos but is fiercely open in its technology. 

Global Distributed Tracking provides transparent insight into the entire life cycle of data stored within its system. It fights counterfeiting by allowing a complete object chain of custody to be constructed. It allows anyone to create, trace, and amend a record via a simple website. The novel use of old-school cryptography avoids requiring people in the global supply chain to authenticate, thus creating maximum convenience for everyone handling an object while also avoiding the sharing of personal data. 


# TECHNICAL PAPERS

Although very much a work in progress, we have written two long-form papers about GOSQAS and the Asset Provenance Tracking system. We invite you to read and even comment on these papers, but understand that they are rough drafts at the moment.
1. [How the Global Open Source Quality Assurance System (GOSQAS) will Promote Global Trust in Open Source for Medical Devices and Supplies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CkJ3Tz7I6DO1TV4CgKxCUxyvJEqqtBEu/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=118089335094003856513&rtpof=true&sd=true) is our basic introductory document.
1. [Provenance Tracking For Low-to-Medium Value Distributed Manufacture](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zEo3x8z_9rtaa8uSj5YuizLrt8Tz5z_DJQiyNo9J6K8/edit?usp=sharing)

# WHO WE HELP
GOSQAS and Global Distributed Tracking (GDT) are independent and cooperative with regulatory bodies such as the FDA. For example, GDT may be used by a distributor making regulated devices to document regulatory requirements with respect to market surveillance and recall. While it can be used by a large manufacturer to track objects internally, GDT can empower rapid, distributed manufacturing, perhaps in response to natural or man-made disasters. Such manufacturers may not have control of their incoming or outgoing supply chain. An open, transparent system that allows easy documentation increases the likelihood of end-user engagement. 

Manufacturers have an easy opt-in pathway to show device trustworthiness via GDT records and keys. 
Distributors have an easy opt-in pathway for chain-of-custody maintenance, which increases buyer trust.
Buyers may easily check chain-of-custody to avoid counterfeits and understand quality assurance transparency.

# ROADMAP FOR SOFTWARE AND FEATURES

We have a functional system and actively seek programming volunteers for the following features. 

* Hierarchical container system
* Notification system development
* Security/zero-knowledge encryption proof
* API

# CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP

Concurrent with the software roadmap, we encourage "social developments" which are not embodied in software. We are developing cultures of:

* Using and documenting standardized quality assurance tests.
* Sharing knowledge about record history evaluation.
* Authenticating quality assurance tester identity.
* Best practices that make fraud impractically difficult.

* The word GOSQAS
* The term "Global Open Source Quality Assurance System"
* The "purple hand with sphere" logo
* Any word art with GOSQAS, GDT, and the "purple hand with sphere" symbol.

# CONTRIBUTING

This is a (mostly) volunteer effort and we need your help. We are organizing volunteers at the [main working repo](https://github.com/gosqasorg/asset-provenance-tracking), please go there and see the Contributing
section of the README, where you will see how to email us directly.

Contributors will be expected to sign our [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://github.com/gosqasorg/home/blob/main/CONTRIBUTOR%20LICENSE%20AGREEMENT.md) based on a template created by the Free Software Foundation Europe which will keep your contributions forever free.

## Other Use Cases

Here are some other real-world use cases that may show the versatility of the GDT provenance tracking system:
* Glia [Otoscope](https://gosqas.org/provenance/JpTWM818HuBbvvsZFQmYQA)
* [Oatmeal Raisin Cookies](https://gosqas.org/provenance/5gckf76pbwP77ri4qaSdck)
* Live Demo: [Nasogastric Tubes](https://gosqas.org/provenance/AkFBdE7GNHHQQVnsdPjegR) 
* Oxygen Concentrator [Maintenance](https://gosqas.org/provenance/65UFxsaUtfM3WbmHr4o7Ch)
* Corsi Box [Construction](https://gosqas.org/provenance/VfPLp8T6DhtzKd2nz93fFJ)

As an exercise, try to think how you would use GDT for your own work!

# Real World Use Cases

## Citizen Science: Turtles

We created a science experiment based on community engagement by posting a GDT QR code near a pond. The sign asked passersby to scan the QR code and input the number of turtles they saw basking outside the water. 
![TurtleSign](https://github.com/gosqasorg/home/assets/5296671/a4be3d73-da64-441f-9f3f-b60530db4daa)

From January 2024 to April 4, 2024, 37 thirty-seven records (twenty of which are photos) have been documented in the GDT key. 
This experiment has inspired the development of additional GDT features and will hopefully encourage citizen science fans to use GDT for their data capture needs.
