# GOSQAS

This is the starting place for the GOSQAS (GAHS-kwahs), Global Open Source Quality Assurance System. GOSQAS and related marks and logos are trademarks of the Global Assurance Quality Assurance System, a US-based project fiscally sponsored by Public Invention. Our development philosophy of “Trust Through Transparency '' (TTT) encourages better global communication within diverse communities- including humanitarian response, open source hardware, and scientific research. 

GOSQAS has developed Global Distributed Tracking (GDT), a software platform that provides the opportunity to create truthful, transparent documentation via an uneditable, append-only record history. Designed specifically for low-resource settings, GDT does not require a login or download and is completely free to use, in addition to being free and open source software. All our code is open source, but we reserve all rights on our trademarks (see below).


# FEATURES
GOSQAS is compatible with existing regulatory bodies, not a competitor, and supports the development of transparency, accountability, and quality assurance for humanitarian purposes. GOSQAS will legally defend marks and logos but is fiercely open in its technology. 

Global Distributed Tracking provides transparent insight into the entire life cycle of data stored within its system. It fights counterfeiting by allowing a complete object chain of custody to be constructed. It allows anyone to create, trace, and amend a record via a simple website. The novel use of old-school cryptography avoids requiring people in the global supply chain to authenticate, thus creating maximum convenience for everyone handling an object while also avoiding the sharing of personal data. 


# TECHNICAL PAPERS

Although very much a work in progress, we have written two long-form papers about GOSQAS and the Asset Provenance Tracking system. We invite you to read and even comment on these papers, but understand that they are rough drafts at the moment.

# WHO WE HELP
GOSQAS and Global Distributed Tracking (GDT) are independent and cooperative with regulatory bodies such as the FDA. For example, GDT may be used by a distributor making regulated devices to document regulatory requirements with respect to market surveillance and recall. While it can be used by a large manufacturer to track objects internally, GDT can empower rapid, distributed manufacturing, perhaps in response to natural or man-made disasters. Such manufacturers may not have control of their incoming or outgoing supply chain. An open, transparent system that allows easy documentation increases the likelihood of end-user engagement. 

Manufacturers have an easy opt-in pathway to show device trustworthiness via GDT records and keys. 
Distributors have an easy opt-in pathway for chain-of-custody maintenance, which increases buyer trust.
Buyers may easily check chain-of-custody to avoid counterfeits and understand quality assurance transparency.




# ROADMAP FOR SOFTWARE AND FEATURES

We now have a functional system and actively seek programming volunteers for the following features. 


* Hierarchical container system
* Notification system development




# CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP

Concurrent with the software roadmap, we encourage "social developments" which are not embodied in software. We are developing cultures of:

* Using and documenting standardized quality assurance tests.
* Sharing knowledge about record history evaluation.
* Authenticating quality assurance tester identity.
* Best practices that make fraud impractically difficult.


# A NOTE ON OUR TRADEMARKS

Although all of our code is open-source, you may not use our trademarks without written permission. Our trademarks include:

* The word GOSQAS
* The term "Global Open Source Quality Assurance System"
* The "purple hand with sphere" logo
* Any word art with GOSQAS, GDT, and the "purple hand with sphere" symbol.
* The phrases "Global Distributed Tracking" and “Global Distributed Tracking (GDT)”
* The acronym “GDT”


# Functional Demo

On June 8th, @devhawk (Harry Pierson) wrote a [quick-and-dirty demo](https://github.com/gosqasorg/asset-provenance-tracking) that he quickly developed into fully functional [minimum viable product (MVP)](https://github.com/gosqasorg/asset-provenance-tracking). We made a brief [video screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FK8fXuefZQ) of this demo.

You may wish to watch this video of a talk we recently delivered at FOSDEM'23 introducing the concept:

# Features
The GDT system allows anyone with a device to trace the provenance and add to it using a simple website. The Seal provides a quick visual impression of the top certifications, and the Key is used to decode the entire provenance. GOSQAS is compatible with existing regulatory bodies, not a competitor, and supports the labeling and tracking of devices and support for decentralized additive manufacturing. GOSQAS will defend marks and logos legally in order to avoid confusion but will be fiercely open in its technology. The GOSQAS system will be implemented in phases, starting with a Maker’s Mark, self-asserted quality, Global Trade Item Number, cryptographically strong provenance, and community provenance checking. This will lead to the GOSQAS seal becoming a visually recognized seal of quality worldwide.

# Real World Use Cases

## Citizen Science: Turtles

We created a science experiment based on community engagement by posting a GDT QR code near a pond. The sign asked passersby to scan the QR code and input the number of turtles they saw basking outside the water. 
![TurtleSign](https://github.com/gosqasorg/home/assets/5296671/a4be3d73-da64-441f-9f3f-b60530db4daa)

From January 2024 to April 4, 2024, 37 thirty-seven records (twenty of which are photos) have been documented in the GDT key. 
This experiment has inspired the development of additional GDT features and will hopefully encourage citizen science fans to use GDT for their data capture needs.

* [Oatmeal Raisin Cookies](https://gosqas.org/provenance/5gckf76pbwP77ri4qaSdck)
* Live Demo: [Nasogastric Tubes](https://gosqas.org/provenance/AkFBdE7GNHHQQVnsdPjegR)

# Who We Help

The GOSQAS asset provenance tracking system is independent and cooperative with regulatory bodies such as the FDA. For example, GOSQAS may be used by a distributor making regulated devices to implement some of it regulatory burden with respect to market surveillance and recall. 
Although it can be used by a large manufacturer to internally track assets, its main goal is to empower rapid, distributed manufacture, 
perhaps in response to natural or man-made disasters. Such manufacturers may not have control of their ingoing or outgoing supply chain.
An open, transparent system that makes it easy for them to document their work makes it more likely to have an impact.

* Manufacturers get an easy opt-in way to make their devices more trustworthy by getting identifying keys and easily documenting manufacture and test.
* Distributors have an easy way to maintain chain-of-custody and maintenance to increase trust for buyers.
* Buyers get an easy way to check chain-of-custody to avoid counterfeits and understand quality transparently.



# Roadmap for Software and Features

We now have a minimal but functional system. However, we could still use competent volunteer help to add features:
* Better tag recognition
* Support for hierarchical container tagging

## Cultural Development Roadmap

Concurrent to the software roadmap, we also need "social developments" which are not embodied in software. We need to develop a culture of:
* Using standardized quality assurance tests and documenting them.
* Sharing knowledge about how to evaluate a provenance.
* Developing a culture of authenticating quality assurance tester identity.
* Developing best practices that make fraud impractically difficult.
